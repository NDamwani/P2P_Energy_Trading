Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Smart Grids Project Overview Author: Nikhil Damwani Supervisor: Dr. Alivelu Manga Parimi

This project delves into the application of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) within smart grid systems, focusing on peer-to-peer energy trading in microgrids. The primary goal is to establish a responsive and economically advantageous energy trading ecosystem among prosumers (consumers and producers).

Background and Motivation The smart grid concept revolutionizes traditional energy systems by integrating renewable energy sources and enabling decentralized energy trading. This project addresses the challenge of optimizing energy distribution and pricing in such a dynamic environment.

Methodology Utilizing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework, the project employs neural networks to facilitate decision-making processes for prosumers. These decisions pertain to optimal pricing strategies and efficient energy consumption or distribution.

Key Results The application of MADRL in this context demonstrates a significant increase in the economic benefits for both prosumers and grid operators. It underlines the potential of this technology to enhance the efficiency and profitability of smart grid energy marketplaces.

Conclusion and Future Work The successful implementation of this project showcases the feasibility and effectiveness of MADRL in smart grid applications. Future work can explore integrating more complex scenarios and diverse energy sources to enhance the system's efficiency and adaptability further.
